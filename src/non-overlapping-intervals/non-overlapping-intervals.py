# https://leetcode.com/problems/non-overlapping-intervals

# First attempt. Idea was to basically store the counts of the observed
# indices, incrementing when an interval was opened an decrementing when
# an interval was closed. This seems to capture intervals conflicting on
# the same indices, but does not capture overlapping intervals with all
# unique indices.
