'''
Key Insights:
    1) Did pretty good on this. Felt like a medium+ instead of a hard.
      Or maybe the practice is just working.

    2) On first attempt, I messed up setting the
      initial value of `size` to low. I set it to 1000, but input size
      could be 10^5. Basically did all the tricky programming correct, and
      goofed on an assumption.

    3) This is basically a harder version of
      'longest-substring-without-repeating-characters', but the premise of
      the solition is the same. Instead of combinining the properties of a
      set and a deque, you combine the properties of a dict and a dequeu
      (although I used Counter instead of dict for slight conveniance).
