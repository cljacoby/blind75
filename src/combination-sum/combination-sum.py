# Vastly improved speed. Key observation that at each recursion, you
# only need to pass in the slice of numbers from the current offset
# forward. This reduces the number of recursions, and means we won't
# encounter re-arrangements of the same numbers. This means we don't
# need to rely on a set to replace duplicates, and can easily use a
# list-of-lists.
# 
# As a minor ergonomic improvement, if you decrement down from target
# rather than up from zero, you can save 1 argument, and a couple add
# instructions.
#
# Passing offset rather than slices reduces memory usage.
