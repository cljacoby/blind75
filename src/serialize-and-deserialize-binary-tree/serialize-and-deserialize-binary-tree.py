# https://leetcode.com/problems/serialize-and-deserialize-binary-tree

'''
Key Insights:
    1.) Kind of annoying that LeetCode's typical format for array
    encoding of a tree throws of this question by adding a bunch of
    nulls to the end. Basically you can't use the same BFS
    deserialization.
    2.) Basically comes down to choosing how you want to format your
    tree in terms of pre-order, in-order, or post-order. Seems like
    pre-order is the easiest.
    3.) Referenced an online solution, and used closures in python. Kind
    of different than my regular coding style, but actually turned out
    kind of nice. Reminded me of how easy closures are in JS.
