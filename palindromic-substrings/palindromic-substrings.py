# https://leetcode.com/problems/palindromic-substrings

# Needed help with this one. Implementation is actually very simple,
# just was lost trying to generate all substr permutations as the base.
# 
# Key observation 1: Start at each string index. Assess if the current
# slice is a palindrome (i.e. outer left == outer right). If it is,
# decrement left index and increment right index. Repeat assessment
# until an index bounds violation, or palindromic assessment breaks.
# 
# Key observation 2: You have to start each palindrome both from a
# single index (i.e. left = right = 3), as well as from 2 adjacent
# indices (i.e. left = 3, right = 4). This is to account for palindromes
# which have an even length overall, and therefore not a singular middle
# position.
