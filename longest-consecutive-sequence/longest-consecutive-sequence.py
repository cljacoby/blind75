# Initial solution was actually very close to the ideal solution. The
# key observations are:
#  1. After creating the set, and iterating back over the numbers, you
#     should be removing observed numbers from the set as you go. You
#     don't need to repeat, as if its still in the set is not part of any
#     already observed sequence.
#   2. In order for point 1 to work correctly without a sorted input,
#      when performing the iteration over the set members, you should
#      increment both up and down to find all current set entries in
#      sequence
