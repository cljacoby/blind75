# https://leetcode.com/problems/longest-repeating-character-replacement


# Overall a pretty simple problem, but needed some help on the
# intiution. I'm  realizing these sliding-window / 2-pointer questions
# are ones I probz need more practice in.
#
# 2 key observations
#
# Substr length:
#  At every iteration, you are considering the window running from the
#  left index, up to *and including* the right index. This means doing:
#    right - left + 1
#  And I was missing the +1
#
# Assessment:
#   Assess if the current substr can have K substitutions to
#   make is a single uniform character. The intiution here is
#   that if you subtract the count of the most frequent
#   character from the total substr length and the difference
#   is less than or equal to K, then it means you have enough
#   free operations to change every other remaining character
#   to match the most frequent character.

            char = s[right]
            d[char] = d.get(char, 0) + 1
            # Get length of current window. Add 1 because its the length
            # of the substring up to and including element at `right`.
            substr_len = right - left + 1
            # Note: Make "Assessment", see note above for more info.

                longest = max(longest, substr_len)

# Wrote a second solution to verify I understand the problem. This is
# probably slower, and definitely consumes more memory, but I think is a
# more intuitive solution, and bares a resemblance to the problem
# "longest-substring-without-repeating-characters". That problem
# combines the behaviors of a queue and a set, whereas this ones
# combines a queue and a hashmap.
